Local CMS on GitHub
Local CMS is a lightweight, extendable content management system (CMS) designed to use GitHub as a data storage backend. It enables users to manage content components like images, text, and titles through a simple interface. The content is stored as JSON in a text file (json.txt) within a selected GitHub repository. This CMS is ideal for small projects, personal portfolios, or experimental setups where a full database might not be required.
